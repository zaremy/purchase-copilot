## The Problem

Buying a used car from a stranger is terrifying. 87% of buyers feel anxiety, and 52% feel taken advantage of. Existing solutions are either too generic (checklists), too passive (history reports), or too expensive (professional inspections).

- Buyers don't know what to check on specific models
- Negotiation is intimidating without data
- Professional inspections cost $200+ and take days

---

## The Solution

A "Contextual Copilot" that uses LLMs to generate vehicle-specific inspection plans, guides the user through the process, and provides real-time negotiation leverage.

- **Contextual Checklist**: "Check the timing chain on this 2012 BMW."
- **Risk Scoring**: Objective 0-100 score based on findings.
- **Negotiation Builder**: "Ask for $500 off because the tires are worn."

---

## Strategic Pillars

### Trust & Safety First
We prioritize user safety with meeting spot recommendations and strictly calibrated LLM advice that never hallucinates safety risks.

### Speed & Accessibility
Priced at $14.99 per vehicle (vs $200 PPI), making professional-grade inspection accessible to everyone instantly.

### Platform Expansion
Starting with consumers, expanding to mechanics (Pro Tier), and eventually specialty vehicles (RVs, Equipment).
