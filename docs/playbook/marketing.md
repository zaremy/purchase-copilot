# Marketing & Advertising

A "Sell First, Build Later" strategy leveraging Web2App funnels and Concierge MVP fulfillment to validate willingness to pay.

---

## The "Fake Door" Strategy

We validate demand by simulating the full product experience before writing complex code.

### Validation Mechanism

1. **The Hook**: "Don't buy a lemon. Get professional-grade inspection insights instantly."

2. **The Offer**: **$39 Lifetime Founder's Edition** (One-time payment).

3. **The "Concierge" Fulfillment**: Instead of automated AI, the founder manually reviews uploads and emails the report within 24 hours.

## Web2App Funnel

Capturing revenue on the web to bypass App Store fees (30%) and own the customer relationship.

### Checkout Flow

1. **Landing Page** — High-fidelity mockups, social proof, and "Money-Back Guarantee" badge.
2. **Web Checkout (Stripe/Paddle)** — User pays $39. Tax compliance handled by MoR.
3. **App Store Redirect** — User receives redemption code or deep link to unlock Pro features in the app.

### Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Hero Section | High-quality app mockup with headline focusing on financial protection |
| Social Proof | "Borrowed Trust" statements (e.g., "Based on ASE inspection standards") |
| Sticky CTA | "Get Lifetime Access" button that follows scroll |

## Acquisition Channels

### AI-Driven Acquisition (AIO)

Optimizing for "Pull" marketing by becoming the cited answer in AI-generated responses (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude).

**Data Source Infiltration:**
- Submit to "Awesome" lists (e.g., Awesome-Self-Hosted)
- List on Open Alternative & Product Hunt
- Create structured schema markup on landing page

**Technical Integration:**
- Publish "How to automate car risk analysis" guides
- Open-source a small "VIN Decoder" utility
- Create an n8n node for vehicle data

**Community Chatter:**
- Announce micro-features on r/usedcars
- Engage in "What car should I buy?" threads
- Write "Building in Public" posts on IndieHackers

### Inbound (SEO/Content)

Targeting "high-intent" keywords where users are already looking for help:
- "Used car inspection checklist pdf"
- "How to check a used car engine"
- "Mechanic inspection cost vs app"

### Community Seeding

Direct engagement in niche communities:
- **Reddit:** r/whatcarshouldibuy, r/usedcars
- **Forums:** Brand-specific forums (Bimmerpost, Rennlist)
- **IndieHackers:** "Building in public" to attract early tech-savvy adopters
