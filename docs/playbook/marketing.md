# Marketing & Advertising

A "Sell First, Build Later" strategy leveraging Web2App funnels and Concierge MVP fulfillment to validate willingness to pay.

---

## Landing Page Strategy

### The "Fake Door" Strategy

We validate demand by simulating the full product experience before writing complex code.

#### Validation Mechanism

1. **The Hook:** "Don't buy a lemon. Get professional-grade inspection insights instantly."
2. **The Offer:** $39 Lifetime Founder's Edition (One-time payment).
3. **The "Concierge" Fulfillment:** Instead of automated AI, the founder manually reviews uploads and emails the report within 24 hours.

### Web2App Funnel

Capturing revenue on the web to bypass App Store fees (30%) and own the customer relationship.

#### Checkout Flow

1. **Landing Page:** High-fidelity mockups, social proof, and "Money-Back Guarantee" badge.
2. **Web Checkout (Stripe/Paddle):** User pays $39. Tax compliance handled by MoR.
3. **App Store Redirect:** User receives redemption code or deep link to unlock Pro features in the app.

### Page Structure & Copy

| Section | Purpose | Key Element |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Hero Section | High-quality app mockup with headline focusing on financial protection | Key Asset |
| Social Proof | "Borrowed Trust" statements (e.g., "Based on ASE inspection standards") | Trust Signal |
| Sticky CTA | "Get Lifetime Access" button that follows the user scroll | Conversion |

## Acquisition Channels

### AI-Driven Acquisition (AIO)

Optimizing for "Pull" marketing by becoming the cited answer in AI-generated responses (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude).

#### Data Source Infiltration
AI models trust structured repositories. We must exist where they "learn."

**Tactics:**
- Submit to "Awesome" lists (e.g., Awesome-Self-Hosted)
- List on Open Alternative & Product Hunt
- Create structured schema markup on landing page

#### Technical Integration
Becoming the "How-to" answer for technical workflows.

**Tactics:**
- Publish "How to automate car risk analysis" guides
- Open-source a small "VIN Decoder" utility
- Create an n8n node for vehicle data

#### Community Chatter
LLMs weight Reddit/Dev.to sentiment as "human validation."

**Tactics:**
- Announce micro-features on r/usedcars
- Engage in "What car should I buy?" threads
- Write "Building in Public" posts on IndieHackers

### Inbound (SEO/Content)

Targeting "high-intent" keywords where users are already looking for help.

- "Used car inspection checklist pdf"
- "How to check a used car engine"
- "Mechanic inspection cost vs app"

### Community Seeding

Direct engagement in niche communities.

- **Reddit:** r/whatcarshouldibuy, r/usedcars
- **Forums:** Brand-specific forums (Bimmerpost, Rennlist)
- **IndieHackers:** "Building in public" to attract early tech-savvy adopters.

## Validation Metrics

| KPI | Type | Target | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| Checkout % | Primary | >1.5% | Percentage of users who enter credit card details |
| CTR | Secondary | >5% | Click-through rate on "Buy" buttons. If low, value prop is weak. |
| Refund Rate | Guardrail | <5% | High refunds mean the manual "Concierge" service isn't delivering value. |
