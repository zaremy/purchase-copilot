# Monetization Strategy

A phased evolution from a simple utility tool to a comprehensive AI-powered marketplace.

---

## Phase 1: Utility Pricing

Focus on user acquisition through a high-value free tool, monetizing only premium convenience features like cloud sync and PDF exports.

### Market Insights

**The "Middle Ground" Trap**: Research indicates that low recurring fees (e.g., $9.99/year) often fail to signal quality and attract high-churn users.

**Strategic Pivot**: Instead of a cheap subscription, we offer a "Founder's Edition" Lifetime Deal ($39) for early adopters. This injects immediate cash flow and avoids subscription fatigue for a utility tool.

**Web2App Advantage**: Leveraging web presence to capture payments before the app store download avoids the 15-30% Apple tax.

### Conversion Funnel (MVP)

1. **Acquisition** — User downloads free app for a specific inspection. No account required.
2. **Activation** — Completes first checklist. "Aha!" moment is the structured guidance.
3. **Monetization** — Paywall triggers on PDF Export or Cloud Backup.

### Pricing Tiers (Phase 1)

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Basic Tool | $0 | Digital Checklist, Local Photo Storage, Basic VIN Decoding |
| Pro Tool | $9.99/year | Unlimited PDF Exports, Cloud Backup & Sync, Multi-Device Access |

## Phase 2: Intelligence Credits

Introduction of the "Credit Model" for AI features. Users pay for the intelligence that saves them money, not just the tool.

### The "Audible" Model

We shift from selling a tool to selling **intelligence**. Users subscribe for credits, which are exchanged for high-value AI reports.

- **Rollover**: Unused credits never expire for active subscribers, reducing churn anxiety.
- **Top-Ups**: Frictionless "Buy 3 More" options when balance hits zero.
- **Breakage**: Revenue from unused credits increases margins over time.

### Retention Loops

- **Market Watch**: "Spend 1 credit to track price drops for this model."
- **Maintenance Mode**: "Upload service records to increase resale value."
- **Referral**: "Give a free report, get a free credit."

### Pricing Tiers (Phase 2)

| Tier | Price | Credits |
|------|-------|---------|
| Single Report | $4.99 | 1 report |
| Enthusiast | $14.99/month | 5 credits (rollover) |
| Power User | $179.99/year | 30 credits/month |

## Phase 3: B2B & Enterprise

Expansion into professional tools for mechanics, dealers, and marketplaces.

### B2B Sales Motion

| Channel | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| Inbound | Mechanics using consumer app upgrade to "Pro" for client management |
| Outbound | Direct sales to small dealerships and credit unions |
| Channel | Partnerships with auto insurance agents as value-add |

### Pricing Tiers (Phase 3)

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Pro / Dealer | $500/year | Multi-User (5 Seats), Commercial License, White-Label Reports |
| Enterprise | Custom | API Access, Data Licensing, SSO Integration |

## Revenue Expansion Path

1. **Transactional (B2C)**: Direct revenue from app users purchasing single reports or 3-packs. High volume, low friction.

2. **SaaS (B2B)**: Recurring revenue from mechanics and dealers. Sticky, high LTV.

3. **Specialty Vertical**: Higher price points ($29.99-$49.99) for RVs, Heavy Equipment, and Boats.

4. **Data Licensing**: Selling anonymized, structured condition data to insurers, lenders, and wholesale marketplaces.
