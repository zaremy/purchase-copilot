# Monetization Strategy

**BUSINESS MODEL**

A phased evolution from a simple utility tool to a comprehensive AI-powered marketplace.

---

## Phase 1: Utility Pricing

Focus on user acquisition through a high-value free tool, monetizing only premium convenience features like cloud sync and PDF exports.

### Market Insights & Critique

#### The "Middle Ground" Trap
Research indicates that low recurring fees (e.g., $9.99/year) often fail to signal quality and attract high-churn users.

**Strategic Pivot:** Instead of a cheap subscription, we will offer a "Founder's Edition" Lifetime Deal ($39) for early adopters. This injects immediate cash flow and avoids subscription fatigue for a utility tool.

#### Web2App Advantage
Leveraging our web presence to capture payments before the app store download avoids the 15-30% Apple tax.

**Implementation:** The "Pre-purchase" landing page will handle the Stripe checkout for the Lifetime Deal, then redirect to the App Store with a redemption code or deep link.

### Conversion Funnel (MVP)

1. **Acquisition** - User downloads free app for a specific inspection. No account required to start.
2. **Activation** - Completes first checklist. "Aha!" moment is the structured guidance.
3. **Monetization** - Paywall triggers on PDF Export or Cloud Backup.

### Pricing Tiers

## Phase 2: Intelligence Credits

Introduction of the "Credit Model" for AI features. Users pay for the intelligence that saves them money, not just the tool.

### Credit Economy Strategy

#### The "Audible" Model
We shift from selling a tool to selling intelligence. Users subscribe for credits, which are exchanged for high-value AI reports.

- **Rollover:** Unused credits never expire for active subscribers, reducing churn anxiety.
- **Top-Ups:** Frictionless "Buy 3 More" options when balance hits zero.
- **Breakage:** Revenue from unused credits increases margins over time.

#### Retention Loops
Mechanisms to keep users engaged between car purchases.

- **Market Watch:** "Spend 1 credit to track price drops for this model."
- **Maintenance Mode:** "Upload service records to increase resale value."
- **Referral:** "Give a free report, get a free credit."

### Pricing Tiers

#### Single Report - $4.99 / report

#### Enthusiast - $14.99 / month

## Phase 3: B2B & Enterprise

Expansion into professional tools for mechanics, dealers, and marketplaces.

### B2B Sales Motion

- **Outbound:** Direct sales to small dealerships and credit unions. Focus on "Risk Reduction" value prop.
- **Channel:** Partnerships with auto insurance agents to offer the app as a value-add to clients.

### 2. SaaS (B2B)
Recurring revenue from mechanics and dealers using the platform for their business operations. Sticky, high LTV.

### 3. Specialty Vertical
Higher price points ($29.99-$49.99) for RVs, Heavy Equipment, and Boats where inspection value is critical.

### 4. Data Licensing
Selling anonymized, structured condition data to insurers, lenders, and wholesale marketplaces.
