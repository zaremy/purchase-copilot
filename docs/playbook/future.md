# Future Opportunities

**INNOVATION PIPELINE**

Beyond the core app, we see massive potential in automation, computer vision, and data monetization.

---

## Agentic Browser
**Year 3+**

An LLM-powered browser agent that can navigate Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and OfferUp to automatically extract vehicle data, photos, and seller info.

**Impact:** Reduces onboarding friction by 90%. Instead of manual entry, users just paste a link.

---

## Computer Vision (VIN OCR)
**Year 2+**

Instant vehicle identification by scanning the VIN barcode on the door jamb or the VIN plate on the windshield.

**Impact:** Critical for "curbside" usage. Allows users to start an inspection in 5 seconds.

---

## Tele-Mechanic Marketplace
**Year 2+**

"ADPList for Mechanics." On-demand video calls with certified mechanics for $50/session to review your checklist findings or listen to engine noise in real-time.

**Impact:** Bridges the gap between DIY ($15) and full PPI ($200). High-margin marketplace revenue.

---

## Pre-PPI Integration
**Year 2.5+**

Positioning as the "digital intake" for professional mechanics. Users export their photos/notes directly into shop software (Tekmetric/Shopware).

**Impact:** Creates a "warm handoff" to B2B partners. Saves mechanics 15 mins of data entry per car.

---

## White-Label Platform
**Year 3+**

Licensing our inspection engine to major marketplaces (Autotrader, Cars.com) as "Powered by Copilot" inspection tools.

**Impact:** Massive distribution. Potential for 1M+ inspections/year via partners.

---

## Data Monetization
**Year 4+**

Selling anonymized, structured condition data to insurance companies (for underwriting) and lenders (for risk assessment).

**Impact:** High-margin revenue stream. We will have the most granular condition data in the industry.
