# Strategic Framework

Our approach combines rigorous Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) analysis with a "Hybrid Morphological" engine to deliver tailored value at scale.

---

## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

### 1. Risk Reduction
**The "Don't Get Scammed" Job**

> "When I am standing in a stranger's driveway, I want to know exactly what to check, so I can avoid buying a lemon."

### 2. Financial Empowerment
**The "Smart Negotiator" Job**

> "When I find issues, I want to translate them into a fair price reduction, so I don't overpay."

### 3. Decision Confidence
**The "No Regrets" Job**

> "When comparing options, I want an objective breakdown, so I can decide without second-guessing."

## The Hybrid Morphological Engine

### The Problem

Generic checklists are overwhelming and often irrelevant. A "Check Turbo" item confuses a user looking at a non-turbo car.

```
Generic List:
- Check Turbo [?]
- Check Convertible Top [?]
- Check 4WD [?]
```

### Our Solution

We use a **Morphological Grid** to dynamically assemble a tailored checklist. The LLM acts as the assembly engine, not just a chatbot.

```
Inputs: [2018 F-150] + [Turbo] + [Rust Belt]
Output:
- Check EcoBoost Turbo Lines (Source: Turbo Module)
- Check Frame Rust (Source: Rust Belt Module)
```

## Riskiest Assumption Tests (RAT)

### 01. The "Pre-PPI" Value Hypothesis

**Assumption:** Users see value in "triaging" cars before paying for a professional mechanic.

**Test:** A/B test landing page messaging ("Mechanic Replacement" vs. "Don't Waste $200 on a Lemon").

---

### 02. The "Morphological Trust" Hypothesis

**Assumption:** Users trust a tailored list more than a generic one.

**Test:** Wizard of Oz study comparing generic vs. tagged checklists.

---

### 03. The "Input Friction" Hypothesis

**Assumption:** Users will answer 4-5 setup questions to get a better result.

**Test:** Funnel analysis on the "Triage Questions" screen.
