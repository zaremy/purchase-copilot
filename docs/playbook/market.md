## Why Now? Market Trends

### Private Party Growth

**Driver:** Rising dealer markups and inventory shortages are pushing buyers to Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace.

### Rising Prices = Higher Risk
Average used car price is **$27,000+** (up 35% since 2020).

**Driver:** Massive demand for "digital hand-holding" and tools that remove social friction.
