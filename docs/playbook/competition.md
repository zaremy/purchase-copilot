# Competitive Landscape

**LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS**

The market is fragmented between expensive professional services and low-tech DIY solutions. No integrated digital workflow exists.

---

## The "Missing Middle"

Buyers currently face a binary choice: **wing it** with a generic PDF checklist (high risk, low cost) or **hire a pro** (low risk, high cost).

Pre-Purchase Copilot fills the massive gap in the middle: **professional-grade guidance at a DIY price point.**

- **vs. Carfax:** We look at the present condition, not just history.
- **vs. LemonSquad:** We cost $15, not $200. Instant, no scheduling.
- **vs. PDF Checklists:** We are interactive, vehicle-specific, and intelligent.

## Direct Competitor Analysis

### CarCheck (iOS)
**Direct Competitor**

- **Pros:** Modern UI, supports multiple vehicles, good comparison view.
- **Cons:** Generic checklist (not vehicle-specific), no AI guidance, low traction.
- **Verdict:** Good UI, but "dumb" logic.

### Checklist Used Cars
**Legacy App**

- **Pros:** Very comprehensive (180+ items), offline mode, privacy-focused.
- **Cons:** Dated UI, no comparison features, static content, one-time purchase model.
- **Verdict:** A digitized paper form.

### OBDeleven
**Hardware Ecosystem**

- **Pros:** Backed by hardware diagnostics, strong enthusiast community.
- **Cons:** Requires dongle for full value, high friction setup, enthusiast-focused UX.
- **Verdict:** Too technical for average buyer.

## Why Others Failed (And Why We Won't)

### Historical Failure Modes

- **Low Frequency/LTV:** Apps died because users buy cars every 6 years. One-time purchase models failed.
- **Generic Content:** "Check tires" isn't worth paying for. Users can get that for free.
- **No Distribution:** Indie devs couldn't afford CAC. No viral loop.

### Our Winning Strategy

- **Episodic Monetization:** Charge per vehicle ($14.99), not subscription. Aligns with user behavior.
- **Hyper-Specific Value:** "Check 2016 BMW N54 Turbo Wastegate" IS worth paying for.
- **SEO/Content Wedge:** Capture users searching for specific car problems (e.g., "F-150 cam phaser noise").
