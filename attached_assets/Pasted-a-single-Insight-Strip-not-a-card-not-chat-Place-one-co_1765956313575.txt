a single Insight Strip (not a card, not chat)

Place one compact insight strip between the comparison table and the action buttons.

Purpose:

Prove Copilot is adding analysis, not restating data

Invite deeper discussion without forcing it

This mirrors how Audi/Porsche manuals add notes under spec tables.

Structure of the Insight Strip
Header (very small, technical)
COPILOT INSIGHT


Uppercase

Neutral-500

Same typographic treatment as other section kickers

Optional subline (even smaller):

Based on price, mileage, model year, and inspection progress

Insight content (1–2 sentences max)

This is critical: no fluff, no adjectives, no hedging language.

Example:

The Accord shows significantly higher inspection coverage (93%) but carries moderate risk due to mileage and known 9th-gen issues.
The Miata’s lower mileage reduces mechanical risk, but inspection coverage is incomplete.

Rules:

Declarative

Comparative

Reads like a technical conclusion, not advice

No “you should” language

Visual treatment

Light background (same as page)

Left hairline rule (same color as homepage cards or checklist advisories)

No rounded corners

No shadow

Same left gutter as the table

This makes it feel annotated, not inserted.

How it connects to “Discuss with Copilot”

Do not embed a chat preview here.

Instead:

Keep your existing “Discuss with Copilot” primary button

Change the microcopy under it to reference the insight

Example subtext under the button:

Ask follow-up questions or challenge this comparison


This creates a clean mental flow:
data → insight → discussion

What NOT to do

No sparkles

No assistant avatar

No “AI says…” language

No expandable accordion here

No repeated insights per row

That would cheapen the engineering tone.

Optional refinement (high-end touch)

If you want one subtle affordance without noise:

Add a small mono tag at the end of the insight line:

[ANALYSIS v1]


or

[MODEL-SPECIFIC]


Very small. Very quiet. Very “internal tooling.”

One-sentence design rule

On Compare, Copilot speaks once, clearly, and technically—then waits for the user to engage.

If you want next, I can:

Draft 3–4 example insight templates

Or help you decide when the insight should not appear (important for trust)
