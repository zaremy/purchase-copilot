### Core decision

* **Overview focus component:** VIN hero (identity artifact).
* **Checklist focus component:** Progress hero (execution artifact).
* Both occupy the same “focus slot” in the layout, but **Checklist’s focus slot must sit under the tabs** to avoid VIN-hero visual logic bleeding into workflow mode.

## Shared layout contract (keeps the app feeling premium)

**Top to bottom**

1. Top app bar (back + title)
2. Vehicle title block (make it feel like a cover)
3. Price / Mileage strip (thin, calm, informational)
4. Tabs
5. **Focus component (page-specific)**
6. Page content

**Why:** Tabs become the mode switch; the focus component becomes the “cover insert” for that mode.

## Premium “cover” typography (one system, two expressions)

Stop relying on icons to create luxury. Do it with type, spacing, and restraint.

### Type rules

* **Title (ACCORD):** larger, slightly tracked, all caps OK if you commit everywhere.
* **Subtitle (2016 HONDA):** smaller, uppercase, tighter tracking, muted.
* Use **monospace only inside VIN**, nowhere else.
* Use **numbers as design objects**: price, VIN, percent.

### Spacing rules

* Focus component gets **air**: generous top/bottom padding, no clutter inside.
* Keep borders hairline. Kill shadows except one subtle, consistent elevation rule (or none).

# OVERVIEW TAB — VIN as the “cover insert”

### Goal

A single, ceremonious identity block that feels like a VIN plate or certificate panel.

### VIN focus component spec

**Placement**

* Keep it where it is (above price) OR move it below tabs; either works.
* If you want strict mode separation: keep VIN **only** on Overview, in the focus slot **below tabs**. That’s the cleanest system.

**Treatment**

* Surface: dark slab or dark outline panel on light background (choose one and lock it).
* Label: “VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER” as small uppercase with tight tracking.
* VIN: monospace, centered, high-contrast.

**Typography**

* Label: 11–12px, uppercase, tracking wide, muted.
* VIN: 18–20px monospace, tracking slightly increased, strong contrast.

**Finish**

* No inner card inside a card.
* No iconography.
* If you keep it dark: add a very subtle border (not shadow). The premium effect comes from silence + precision.

### What to remove on Overview

* Progress UI. No percent. No bar. No “inspection” language.
* Avoid CTA near VIN; it dilutes ceremony.

# CHECKLIST TAB — Progress bar as the “cover insert”

### Goal

Swap identity ceremony for execution ceremony: a precise, high-end “completion instrument.”

### Where it goes

* **Directly under tabs** (your instinct is correct).
* This makes the mode switch immediate: tabs → instrument → work.

### Progress focus component spec

Do not make it look like a generic progress component. Make it look like an “inspection rail.”

**Structure**

1. Section label: “INSPECTION”
2. Completion number: “93%” (large, typographic)
3. Progress rail: thin bar
4. Secondary action: “VIEW DOSSIER” appears at threshold, aligned to the rail (not floating elsewhere)

**Typography**

* “INSPECTION”: 11–12px uppercase, tracking wide, muted.
* “93%”: 28–34px, medium weight, tight tracking (let the number be the hero).
* “complete” (optional): tiny muted text, not necessary if the number is clear.
* “VIEW DOSSIER”: same style as tabs (uppercase, tracked), but muted until enabled.

**Rail**

* Height: 2px (max 3px).
* Background rail: hairline gray.
* Fill: brand red, but slightly desaturated (avoid neon).
* Endcaps: square (technical) or very slight radius—match global radius rule.

**Behavior**

* When threshold reached, “VIEW DOSSIER” appears as text button on the right of the header row, not below the bar.
* The bar stays calm; the number carries the status.

### What to remove on Checklist

* The VIN slab entirely.
* Any icon next to completion (gauges, checks) inside the focus component. The number + rail is enough.

## “Cover feel” upgrades you can apply immediately

### 1) Vehicle title block as cover typography

Right now it’s serviceable. Make it feel intentional:

* Increase vertical spacing above/below the title.
* Tighten tracking on “ACCORD” and reduce weight slightly.
* Keep “2016 HONDA” small, muted, and rigid.

### 2) Price/Mileage strip becomes a calm spec line

* Reduce the visual weight of “PRICE” and “MILEAGE” labels.
* Align the number baselines (price and mileage should feel like the same typographic family).
* Keep icons out or make them hairline-consistent; they currently read as decorative.

### 3) Tabs indicator refinement

* Underline should be thinner and only under the word.
* Active tab text: slightly stronger contrast; inactive: still legible.
* This keeps focus on the hero component that follows.

---

## Summary: the reconciled system

* Tabs define **mode**.
* Focus component defines **page identity**.

  * Overview: VIN plate (monospace ceremony).
  * Checklist: progress instrument (numeric ceremony).
* Premium feel comes from:

  * one typographic system,
  * fewer surfaces,
  * deliberate spacing,
  * numbers treated as primary visual elements,
  * no “UI decoration” competing with the focus block.
