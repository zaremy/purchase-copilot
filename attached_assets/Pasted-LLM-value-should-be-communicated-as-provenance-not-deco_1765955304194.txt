LLM value should be communicated as provenance, not decoration.

Audi/Porsche manuals don’t say “AI helped here.”
They say: “Vehicle-specific advisory”, “Conditional check”, “Applies to vehicles with X.”

That’s your aesthetic.

The right mental model

Think TSB / service bulletin overlays, not magic hints.

The LLM is:

not a character

not an assistant popping in

a silent augmentation layer that modifies the checklist

Do NOT do these

Sparkles

Glowing icons

Per-row emoji or novelty badges

Page-level banners that repeat every visit

Anything that reads as “chat UI leaking into checklist”

Those all cheapen the engineering feel.

The correct solution: a two-layer signal system
Layer 1 — Page-level provenance (subtle, once)

At the top of Checklist, near “INSPECTION STATUS”, add a single line of technical provenance.

Example:

TAILORED FOR THIS VEHICLE
Based on model year, drivetrain, mileage, and known issues


Styling:

uppercase

very small

neutral-400

no icon, or a tiny dot/diamond if needed

This tells the user once:
“This is not generic.”

Then get out of the way.

Layer 2 — Row-level specificity (where it matters)

Only mark rows that were materially altered by the LLM.

Not every row. Only the ones where:

extra checks were added

priority changed

risk is higher for this car

How to mark those rows (elegant)

Use language + structure, not icons.

Option A — Conditional subline (best)

Under the row label, add a small secondary line:

ENGINE
• Inspect starter motor
  Applies to 2013–2017 Accord; higher failure rate reported


Styling:

secondary line

smaller

muted

indented slightly

no icon

This reads like a service manual note.

Option B — Severity reordering (very powerful)

LLM-augmented rows appear higher in their section.

No badge.
No sparkle.
Just priority.

Users feel the intelligence without being told.

Optional: a single glyph, if you must

If you absolutely want a visual affordance:

Use a small hollow dot or diamond at the far right of the row

Same color as secondary text

No motion

Tooltip or drill-in explains: “Vehicle-specific advisory”

Never put it on the left. Left edge is for structure, not commentary.

What NOT to mark

Do not mark:

generic checks

unchanged rows

everything “just because AI touched it”

If everything is special, nothing is.

Why this works

Preserves engineering credibility

Communicates value without shouting

Feels like Audi/Porsche documentation

Avoids “AI gimmick” backlash

Scales cleanly as models get more complex

One sentence to design against

“This checklist quietly adapts to the vehicle, and only speaks up when that adaptation matters.”
