### What your UI is doing well (from the screenshot)

* Clear hierarchy: dark “COPILOT” masthead, then a single “Active Dossiers” KPI card, then “Your Garage” list.
* Restraint: mostly monochrome with one accent (red). That’s the right direction for an Audi-ish “technical” feel.

### Where it’s visually breaking right now

1. **Mixed radius language**

   * Header is hard-edged; cards are soft-rounded; FAB is heavily rounded with a big shadow. That combination reads “generic mobile kit,” not “premium technical.”
2. **Too many elevation cues**

   * You have card borders + shadows + inset-looking separators. Pick one primary depth mechanic and make it consistent.
3. **Card chrome isn’t controlled**

   * The “Active Dossiers” card has extra corner artifacting (your earlier “quarter circle” note). That’s usually a radius mismatch between parent/child layers (background, border, shadow, pseudo-element) or an absolutely-positioned element clipping weirdly.

### Use the style guide the safe way (so Replit + Tailwind doesn’t get weird)

Your attached PDF is specifically about **logo usage** (color variants, protective zone, and background rules), not a full UI system. Treat it as: “one accent red, disciplined background, negative logo on dark, no noisy backgrounds.” 

Concrete takeaways you can safely translate into UI tokens:

* Prefer **white / aluminum-like neutrals**; avoid “random colored” surfaces. 
* Use a **negative (white) mark on dark** when you go dark. 
* Keep a **protective zone** (clear space) around the mark; apply that thinking to header spacing. 
* Keep the accent **Audi red** constrained (don’t start tinting lots of components). 

### Styling upgrades that won’t confuse Replit

This is the high-signal path: **tokens → a few component variants → delete ad-hoc tweaks.** Keep everything inside Tailwind + shadcn patterns; avoid scattered CSS files.

#### 1) Lock a small token set (Tailwind + CSS variables)

* Background: `--bg` (white), `--bg-muted` (aluminum-ish light gray), `--bg-dark` (near-black)
* Text: `--fg`, `--fg-muted`
* Lines: `--stroke` (light border), `--stroke-strong`
* Accent: `--accent` (the single red)

Result: you can “jack up” the look by adjusting *tokens* once, without chasing 40 class strings.

#### 2) Pick one corner system and enforce it

Audi-like tends to read better with **low-radius**.

* Set cards to something like `rounded-md` max.
* Kill mixed radii inside cards: children should inherit rounding or be square.

#### 3) Choose one depth model: border-first, shadow-second

Recommended for “technical”:

* Default cards: **border + flat**
* Only primary KPI card: **subtle shadow**
* List items: **no shadow**, just dividers

#### 4) Fix the “quarter circle” artifact properly (most likely causes)

Implement these in order (they’re deterministic):

* Ensure the card root has `overflow-hidden` and the same `rounded-*` as its background layer.
* If there’s a `::before/::after` highlight, remove it or set `border-radius: inherit`.
* If the card uses `ring-*` + `shadow-*`, drop one. Rings often create corner artifacts on dark-on-light transitions.
* If an icon/button is absolutely positioned in the corner, confirm it’s not extending beyond the radius and getting clipped strangely.

#### 5) Make the “technical typography” consistent

* Section headers (“YOUR GARAGE”, “ARCHIVED”): all-caps, tight tracking, muted foreground.
* Data labels: small, uppercase.
* Values: larger, normal case.
* Reduce font variety; rely on weight + tracking.

#### 6) Rework the FAB so it doesn’t fight the system

Current FAB is very “Material.” For your direction:

* Make it smaller, flatter, less glow.
* Use border + minimal shadow.
* Keep the red as an accent, not a neon beacon.

### Net effect

* Cleaner, more “engineered,” less app-template.
* Changes are centralized (tokens + 3–5 component variants), so you won’t get into Replit “vibe-coded spaghetti.”
