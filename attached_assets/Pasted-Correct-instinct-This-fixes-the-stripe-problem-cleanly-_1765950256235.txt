Correct instinct. This fixes the stripe problem cleanly without touching typography weight.

Here’s the **precise reconciliation**, no fluff.

---

## The real fix

**Move the tabs into the dark focus area and make them pill-style.**
This collapses multiple visual seams into one intentional “control band.”

---

## New page structure (lock this)

### Dark focus region (single continuous block)

1. Masthead
2. Tabs (pill style)
3. Focus component (VIN on Overview / Progress on Checklist)

All three share:

* Same dark background
* No dividers between them
* One visual mass

This eliminates striping entirely.

---

## Tabs: pill-style, iOS logic (not Material)

### Why this works

* Pills are **controls**, not navigation bars
* They belong in a dark control zone
* They don’t demand a full-width underline or divider

### Pill spec

* Container: dark background (same as masthead)
* Inactive pill:

  * Transparent background
  * Light text (muted)
* Active pill:

  * White background
  * Dark text
  * No shadow
  * Subtle radius (iOS-style, not bubbly)

No underline. No bar. No motion drama.

Typography does the work.

## Overview tab behavior

**Dark region contains:**

* Masthead
* Pills (Overview active)
* VIN slab

VIN slab stays heavy.
Tabs now *frame* it instead of slicing above it.

Then a **hard break** to light background for:

* Vehicle title
* Price / mileage
* Specs

One break. That’s it.

---

## Checklist tab behavior

**Dark region contains:**

* Masthead
* Pills (Checklist active)
* Progress focus (number + rail)

VIN disappears entirely here.

Then a **hard break** to light background for:

* Checklist items
* Sections

Again: one break only.

---

## What this solves immediately

* Eliminates horizontal striping
* Removes the awkward “tabs floating in light space”
* Makes tabs feel premium and intentional
* Lets the slab keep its authority
* Restores clear mode separation (identity vs execution)

---

## Do NOT do these

* Don’t give pills shadows
* Don’t add borders around the pill group
* Don’t change background again below the focus component
* Don’t reintroduce underlines

---

## One sentence rule to code against

**Header + pills + focus component are one dark control surface; everything else is one light content surface.**

If you implement exactly this, the layout will snap into place without further aesthetic churn.
